Description: A post-estimation method for categorical response models (CRM). 
    Inputs from objects of class serp(), clm(), polr(), multinom(), mlogit(), 
    vglm() and glm() are currently supported. Available tests include the 
    Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for the binary, multinomial and ordinal logistic 
    regression; the Lipsitz and the Pulkstenis-Robinson tests for the ordinal 
    models. The proportional odds, adjacent-category, and constrained continuation-ratio 
    models are particularly supported at ordinal level. Tests for the proportional 
    odds assumptions in ordinal models are also possible with the Brant and the 
    Likelihood-Ratio tests. Moreover, several summary measures of predictive strength 
    (Pseudo R-squared), and some useful error metrics, including, the brier 
    score, misclassification rate and logloss are also available for the 
    binary, multinomial and ordinal models. See the following references for 
    further details about the implemented methods: Ugba, E. R. and Gertheiss, J. (2018)
