### Overview

Post-estimation (goodness-of-fit) tests for some widely used categorical response models (CRM). Package currently supports inputs from objects of class serp(), clm(), polr(), multinom(), mlogit(), vglm() and glm(). Available tests include the Hosmer-Lemeshow, the Lipsitz and the Pulkstenis-Robinson tests for the binary, multinomial and ordinal logistic regression models. The proportional odds, adjacent category, and constrained continuation-ratio models are particularly supported at the ordinal level. Tests for the proportional odds assumptions in ordinal models are also possible with the Brant and the Likelihood-Ratio tests. Moreover, several summary measures of predictive strength (Pseudo R-squared) and error measurement metrics (brier score, misclassification rate and logloss) are also available for the binary, multinomial and ordinal models.

### Example

``` r
require(serp)
set.seed(1)
n <- 200
dt <- data.frame(y = ordered(rbinom(n,2,0.5)), x1 = factor(rbinom(n,2,0.7)), x2 = runif(n))
sp <- serp(y ~ x1 + x2, slope="parallel", link = "logit", reverse= TRUE, data = dt)
```

``` r
## Goodness-of-fit
# Hosmer-Lemeshow test
hosmerlem(sp, tables = TRUE)
hosmerlem(sp, tables = TRUE, customFreq = rep(20,10))

# Lipsitz test
lipsitz(sp)
lipsitz(sp, customFreq = rep(20, 10))

# Pulkstenis-Robinson test
pulkroben(sp, test = "chisq", tables = TRUE)
pulkroben(sp, test = "deviance", tables = TRUE)
```

``` r
## Proportional odds test
brant.test(sp)
brant.test(sp, global = TRUE, call = TRUE)
LR.test(sp, call = TRUE)
```

``` r
## Error metrics
erroR(sp, type = "brier")
erroR(sp, type = "logloss")
erroR(sp, type = "misclass")

# with dataframe and custom threshold
df <- data.frame(y, sp$fitted.values)
erroR(df, type = "misclass", thresh = 0.7)
```

``` r
## Summary metrics
Rsquared(sp, measure = "ugba")
Rsquared(sp, measure = "mcfadden")
```
